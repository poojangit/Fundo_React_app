----------------------npx--------------------
is a npm package runner which gets installed when you install node and that is how we are directlt able to run create-react-app without having to install it. npc takes care of it

npx create-react-app<project_name>

----------------------npm---------------------
here we create create-react-app globally and then use package to generate the package globally

npm install create-react-app -g
create-react-app<project-name>

---------------------------components-------------------------

components describe a part of the UI.
they are re-usable and can be nested inside other components.
it is a building blocks of any react application.
components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
components can be reused

stateless functional components: 
The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

statefull class components - are the regular ES6 classes that extends the component class from the react lib
they must contain a render method, which in turn return the HTML

class Welcome extends React.components {
render() {
return  <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
}
}

------------------------functional components-------------

They are simply a javascript functions.
They optionally recieves a properties as props and returns HTML(JSX) which describe the UI
